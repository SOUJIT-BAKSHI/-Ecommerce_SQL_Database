ðŸ”¹ Project Title:
SQL for Data Analysis using an Ecommerce Database

Task Objective:
To utilize SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an e-commerce database to gain insights, optimize queries, and apply data manipulation techniques.

Tools Used:
Interface: MySQL Workbench

Step-by-Step Tasks:
Create a Sample Database
Build a small ecommerce database with tables like:

Customers

Products

Orders

Order Items

Payments

Fill the Tables with Sample Data
Add around 20 records in each table to make the data look real.

Perform Data Analysis Using SQL
Run different types of SQL queries to answer questions like:

*Which products are expensive?
*Who are the top customers?
*What is the total sales for each product category?
*How many orders did each customer place?

Use Key SQL Features
While writing queries, make sure you use:

Filtering and sorting (like search and order)

Grouping (to summarize)

Joining multiple tables

Views (like saved queries)

Indexes (to make queries faster)

Take Screenshots
After each important query, take a screenshot of your SQL code and result
